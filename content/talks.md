I enjoy writing and delivering talks about modern history, the notes for which will be available here.

Upcoming talks that I am working on include:

* The German Occupation of the Channel Islands in World War 2

If you would like me to give a talk at your local group, [drop me an email](/contact/) and I'll see what I can do. Please bear in mind that I work full time and don't make any money out of speaking or writing about history, so the number of talks I can give is limited.
